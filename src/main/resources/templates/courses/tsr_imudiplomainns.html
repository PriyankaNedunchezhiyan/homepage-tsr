            <article>N/A<!--Established in the year 1910 as an Orphanage by the Late Haji Ismail Yusuf, it was converted to a Marine School and later a College by his eldest son Sir Mohamed Yusuf and has the unique distinction of not only being the first and the only one of its type in South Asia, but also the first to train Indians as Officers for the Merchant Marine. This Nautical Training Institute was later renamed as "Training Ship Rahaman" in 1972 by the late Chairman (Emeritus), Mr. A. Rashid Yusuf, in memory of his father Mr. Abdul Rahaman, the first President of the Managing Board ( and the eldest son of Sir Mohamed Yusuf). This pioneering Establishment has over the last nine decades, served the Marine community with dedication. The Institution conducts Pre Sea Courses besides various other STCW Courses on its premises. The courses are recognised by the Directorate General of Shipping, Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways, Government of India."--></article>
